- I worked on a project that involved working with **Epipolar geometry** and **Point Cloud** concepts to generate accurate **3D point clouds** for capturing cartons from pallets.

- The resulting point clouds were highly accurate and reliable, making the system a valuable tool for a variety of industries and applications.

- Performed testing on both the point cloud and disparity map. Finally, I created a demo and documentation for the project.
