- During my internship, I gained experience in structuring data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using univariate and bivariate analysis, correlation, and visualization techniques. I also applied linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to gain insights from the data.
