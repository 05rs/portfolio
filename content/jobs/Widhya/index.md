I participated in the **Widhya Wintership 2021** as a **Machine Learning intern**, where I had the opportunity to work on several micro-projects.

1. **COVID19 Quantitative Analysis and Modeling**, where I used various machine learning algorithms to predict the spread of the virus and analyze its impact on different populations.

2. **Predicted flight delays** using historical data and machine learning techniques. This involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to create an accurate prediction model that could be useful for airlines and travelers alike.

3. **Instagram reach prediction**, using data analysis and machine learning to understand the factors that contribute to post engagement and develop a model for predicting reach.

4. **Stock Price Prediction**, using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future prices. This involved data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation, and the resulting predictions could be useful for investors and traders.

Overall, my experience in the Widhya Wintership gave me the opportunity to work on a variety of interesting and challenging projects, developing my skills in machine learning and data analysis while exploring real-world applications.
